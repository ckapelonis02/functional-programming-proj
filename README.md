# Project: Functional Programming

This project contains two parts of the *Functional Programming* course.

It is implemented in Scala and uses Functional Programming tactics to perform Big Data analytics over a state-of-the-art Big Data Platform, 
namely Apache Spark, while exploring the Reuters and Aegean Datasets.

We use Spark RDDs as well as Spark Dataframes.

Apart from the local configurations, it can also be run on the [SoftNet](https://www.softnet.tuc.gr/en) cluster.
