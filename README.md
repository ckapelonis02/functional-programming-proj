# Project: Functional Programming

This project contains two parts of the *Functional Programming* course.

It is implemented in Scala and uses Functional Programming tactics to perform Big Data analytics over a state-of-the-art Big Data Platform, 
namely Apache Spark, while exploring the Reuters and Aegean Datasets.

We use Spark RDDs as well as Spark Dataframes.
